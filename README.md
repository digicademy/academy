# Academy Current Research Information System (CRIS)

## About

The "Academy" extension implements a framework for creating Current Research Information Systems (CRIS) with TYPO3. At its core it features a data model closely aligned to the [CERIF standard](https://eurocris.org/eurocris_archive/cerifsupport.org/cerif-in-brief/index.html) and the [OpenAIRE Guidelines for CRIS Managers](https://openaire-guidelines-for-cris-managers.readthedocs.io/en/v1.1.1/). The extension can be used as a foundation for creating web based research information portals and databases with projects, persons, organizations, research products, news, events etc.

The extension has been in development by @digicademy since 2011 and is actively used as a basis for several CRIS projects of the Academy of Sciences and Literature | Mainz in cooperation with many partners:

* [Academy of Sciences and Literature | Mainz](https://www.adwmainz.de/)
* [A European Gateway for the Academies of Sciences and Humanities (AGATE)](https://agate.academy/)
* [Portal of Rare Disciplines](https://www.kleinefaecher.de/)
* [NFDI4Culture - Consortium for Research Data on Material and Immaterial Cultural Heritage](https://nfdi4culture.de/)
